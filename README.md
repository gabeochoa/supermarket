TODOs

Game 

player should be able to control price of items
+ player gets feedback from customers on price and quantity 
+ feedback should be centralized on item so if you miss popups its findable
player should have to buy items 
+ which take time to get shipped to store
+ can hire an inventory manager to do this automatically

Allow player to label aisles 
+ makes it easier for customers to find the item they want
+ gives stockers faster stocking times since they only need to stock when aisle is empty

Customers leaving items around
+ Another stock job to put items back

Customers will leave if lines are too long 

Stealing items
+ Hire security manager
+ Hire security employees 
+ Video Cameras


Weather and day night system
+ Different desires based on these (less ice cream in winter) 

Highlight text in inventory manager when not ideal? 
+ Maybe an upgrade if you buy a "Buyer" manager or something
+ Red means too expensive etc 

Can you price all your items at $0? 
+ Whats the min price / Whats the max price? 

Can you offer sales when you need to get rid of things? 
Do items spoil? so you have to sell or eat the cost ... 

Different kinds of people
+ Stoners (buy 10x the amount of food they plan to buy)
+ Shoplifters 
+ Old people (move slower) 
+ Kids (place things on wrong shelves) 

Actually have the push a cart around?
